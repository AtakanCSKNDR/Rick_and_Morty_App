# Rick And Morty

## What is this ? 
```
The Rick and Morty API is a RESTful and GraphQL API based on the television show Rick and Morty. You will have access to about hundreds of characters, images, locations and episodes. The Rick and Morty API is filled with canonical information as seen on the TV show.
```
## Why did I build this? 
```
Because I was really interested in the idea of writing an open source project and also because Rick and Morty is my favorite show at the moment, SO WHY NOT?
